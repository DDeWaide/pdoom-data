    "summary": "Trump has given Iran a 10-day ultimatum while deploying a second aircraft carrier \u2014 because nothing says 'let's negotiate' like two nuclear-powered floating airports parked outside your door. Oil prices hit six-month highs, Russia and Iran are running joint naval drills, and CNBC is already running the 'what this means for your gas bill' segment. Meanwhile, the UN confirmed Sudan's RSF campaign bears 'hallmarks of genocide,' which is doing its quiet, horrifying work in the background while everyone watches the Iran clock tick down.",

A massive aircraft carrier dominates the left of the frame, its 1,100-foot flight deck lit by harsh yellow deck lights casting long orange shadows across rows of folded-wing aircraft parked wing-to-wing, a grey destroyer escort barely visible as a silhouette trailing in phosphorescent wake. On the far Iranian coastline to the right, a barren desert plateau rises from the water's edge \u2014 ventilation shafts and geometric concrete emplacements emerge from the hillside, their edges catching the orange glow of floodlights from below, anti-aircraft batteries rendered as angular pixel shadows pointing skyward. In the middle distance, the flat steel-blue water reflects a broken ladder of carrier deck lights, the reflection trembling. A countdown clock motif \u2014 not literal text but a digital instrument panel glow in deep amber \u2014 pulses from within the carrier's island superstructure windows. Heavy shadows dominate every surface. The warmth in this scene feels like a warning. Deep navy and smoldering orange throughout, smoke-filtered, no natural light, all illumination artificial and threatening.",
