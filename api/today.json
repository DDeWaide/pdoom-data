Japan is also deploying missiles to an island 100km from Taiwan, US-Iran talks are circling the drain, and the State of the Union was mostly vibes \u2014 so the humans aren't exactly outperforming the robots on restraint.",

A vast American Southwest desert landscape dominated by golden-hour haze and warm atmospheric dust, the entire scene filtered through a radiant amber-teal atmosphere as late afternoon sun rakes low across the high desert, long shadows stretching across red-ochre earth while heat shimmer and fine particulate haze blur the horizon into layers of peach and deep teal blue. Hundreds of utility-scale solar panels stretch in perfect geometric rows vanishing into the hazy distance, their dark blue-black surfaces catching the raking light and flashing copper and amber through the golden dust. White rectangular battery storage containers sit flush against the near solar arrays, thick cable conduits running along the ground connecting them. In the middle distance, barely visible through the warm haze, a river dam and concrete spillway recede into soft atmospheric blur \u2014 older, earthen, being stepped past. Tall steel lattice transmission towers carry silver power lines away toward an unseen city, the lines themselves catching light through the dust. A single small figure in a high-visibility orange vest stands on a slight ridge at the edge of the panel field, hand raised to shield eyes, tiny against the monumental panorama, the enormous layered sky above glowing deep teal at the zenith fading through warm amber haze to a radiant peach horizon. Quietly triumphant, unstoppable momentum rendered in 16-bit SNES palette.",
