    "summary": "A suicide bombing at an Islamabad mosque killed 31 people, marking a sharp escalation in Pakistan's security crisis. Combined with ongoing tensions in the Middle East (U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, Hamas rejecting disarmament), the Gaza humanitarian catastrophe (unidentified mutilated bodies returned), and Red Sea instability threatening global trade, we're seeing a multi-front geopolitical deterioration. The baseline chaos is elevated, though not yet systemic.",
