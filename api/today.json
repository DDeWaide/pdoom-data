The Strait of Hormuz sits ominously over the global economy like a cork over a very expensive bottle, and OpenAI just signed a deal with the 'Department of War' while everyone was distracted by the actual war. Russia and China are diplomatically furious but militarily sidelined \u2014 which is arguably the only thing keeping this from a clean 90%.",

Through the obscuring storm, barely resolved shapes emerge: the vast dark silhouette of a Nimitz-class supercarrier sits heavy in the churning Gulf chop, its flight deck a smear of ember-orange exhaust glow bleeding into the surrounding murk, F/A-18 silhouettes crouched on catapults like coiled threats, indistinct through rain curtains. Closer to the Iranian coastline \u2014 a low jagged silhouette of desert bluffs and radar dish arrays rendered in deep ash grey \u2014 mobile TEL launchers sit on hardpan desert, their ballistic missiles canted upward at 45 degrees, half-swallowed by blowing dust, ominous in stillness. In the far distance, a walled compound in northern Tehran shows one corner crumbled, smoke rising into the storm and immediately torn horizontal by wind. Arleigh Burke destroyers cut through Gulf chop as dark wedge shapes, vertical launch cells glowing faint crimson from below. Oil tankers on the horizon are ghost shapes in the haze. The entire palette is crimson, ember-orange, and ash grey \u2014 no clean light source exists, only fire-glow filtered through atmospheric violence, crushing shadow density between every element, rain streaks rendered as white diagonal pixel lines across the whole frame.",

Extreme close-up filling the entire frame with a single glowing molecular groove \u2014 the notch in the MurJ protein \u2014 rendered in ribbon-like curves of pale gold and sage green, luminous and warm as morning light pressing through laboratory glass. The groove dominates the frame, a small indentation shaped like a keyhole, its inner walls catching pale amber light that radiates outward into soft mist. Pressed into the groove from the left edge of the frame, a golden key-shaped Sgl protein molecule, geometric and precise, its tip just making contact with the lock \u2014 the moment of discovery frozen. The surrounding protein structure fans outward in layered ribbons of sage green and dusty blue, curling off into soft focus at the frame edges. Reflected faintly in the glossy surface of the molecular structure, barely visible as edge detail: the warm blur of a California laboratory window, a glowing monitor, two small silhouetted figures leaning forward together. In the deep background implied through color bleed alone, warm gold chainmail texture suggests the bacterial cell wall waiting to be breached. The entire palette is pale gold and sage green emerging through morning mist, gentle warmth building from the center of the groove outward, the kill switch on the edge of being thrown.",
