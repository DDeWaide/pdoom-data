    "summary": "The Supreme Court struck down Trump's signature tariff policy, prompting him to immediately pivot to a 15% flat tariff 'effective immediately' \u2014 because when the ref blows the whistle, you just pick up the ball and run anyway. Meanwhile the Iran situation has gone notably quiet, no new ultimatums or carrier movements, suggesting we've downshifted from imminent-strike energy to tense-negotiation energy. The dominant story today is constitutional chaos dressed up as economics, with a $175 billion refund tab looming and Europeans apparently celebrating SCOTUS decisions more enthusiastically than Americans.",
