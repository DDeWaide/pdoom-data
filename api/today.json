Rubio meanwhile is calling Iran's missile reluctance a 'big, big problem,' which in diplomatic language translates roughly to 'we are very close to something bad.' Throw in Kim Jong Un threatening to 'completely destroy' South Korea in the same news cycle, and the nuclear category is doing a lot of heavy lifting today.",

A rural Myanmar village kitchen interior viewed from inside, the far wall open to a blazing golden-amber dawn sky beyond the forest treeline, dense tropical canopy standing tall and intact against the radiant horizon, warm teal light bleeding upward into deep amber at the threshold between forest and sky. The entire room is backlit by this dual glow \u2014 the magnificent dawn outside and the small controlled orange ember-heart of an efficient cookstove burning in the foreground. Two silhouetted figures dominate the composition: a woman in a traditional longyi crouching beside the compact stove, her silhouette clean and upright, and a small girl beside her, both rendered as pure dark shapes against the luminous backdrop. The cookstove firebox glows vivid orange-gold at its narrow combustion chamber, a second small sun casting warm light forward onto earthen floor. Above the figures, where smoke would have been, the air is clear \u2014 haze dissolving upward into open light. A modest pile of unburned firewood sits to one side, untouched. Through the open wall, the intact forest edge glows teal-green against amber sky. An arc of gold light curves faintly across the sky like a trade route, connecting two distant illuminated points. Long dramatic side-shadows stretch across the floor. Deep golden hour amber and warm teal. Radiant, intimate, triumphant.",
