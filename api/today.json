    "summary": "Trump is now openly 'considering' a limited military strike on Iran \u2014 which is either maximum pressure diplomacy or the world's most expensive game of chicken, with two carrier strike groups as the ante. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court slapped down his tariffs and he responded by immediately signing new ones, suggesting the president's relationship with legal constraints is approximately as stable as Iran's relationship with centrifuges. The Middle East buildup that's been climbing all week now has an explicit strike-contemplation attached, nudging the needle further into uncomfortable territory.",
