    "summary": "Trump has now attached an explicit countdown to his Iran threats \u2014 10 to 15 days, or 'bad things happen' \u2014 while a second aircraft carrier closes in and Iran responds by running naval drills with Russia. That's not de-escalation, that's a pressure cooker with a timer glued to it. Add three Silicon Valley engineers caught funneling Google trade secrets to Tehran and you've got a threat profile that's personal, military, and technological all at once.",

This is not naive optimism; it is a real event that happened today, proving that extraordinary private generosity still exists outside the news cycle of dread.
