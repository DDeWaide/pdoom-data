    "summary": "The Iran pressure cooker just got turned up another notch: we've gone from carrier diplomacy to 'attack options discussed, possible strike this weekend' in the span of 48 hours. Meanwhile Tehran and Moscow are playing naval footsie in joint drills, Sudan is notching 'hallmarks of genocide,' and Russia-Ukraine talks collapsed after two hours \u2014 apparently even the negotiators couldn't be bothered. The two-carrier standoff from yesterday now has a specific timeline attached, which is exactly the kind of escalation that moves the needle.",
