The enormous landscape dominates completely, crisscrossed with the faint ghost-lines of old perimeter fencing now being dismantled. Scattered across the meadow below, tiny deminer figures in reinforced gear work methodically, pulling red skull-and-crossbones warning stakes from the sun-warmed earth, the removed signs lying flat in the grass like fallen soldiers. A loose cluster of wildflowers \u2014 yellows and whites \u2014 blooms in wild profusion exactly where a fence line once stood, vivid against the sage and gold. A tiny Croatian flag is raised on open ground near a cluster of minuscule officials. Boot prints trace fresh paths through soft soil where no foot stepped for thirty years. The entire scene glows with pale gold and sage green emerging through dissolving morning mist, gentle warmth building from the east, the endless liberated countryside stretching to a hazy horizon of limestone hills.",
