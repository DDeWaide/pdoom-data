Interior of a Stanford Medicine research laboratory viewed from inside looking outward through a wide doorway, the doorway frame cutting the composition into warm interior and cool corridor beyond.

The lab environment fills the frame \u2014 gleaming white bench surfaces, neat rows of small vials and petri dishes, a whiteboard covered in branching immune system diagrams connecting two convergent rivers of annotation. A slender translucent nasal spray bottle sits upright at the center of the nearest bench, illuminated by a golden desk lamp so it glows like a tiny lantern, embarrassingly small, radiating warm amber light. A younger researcher leans over the bench holding the spray vial up toward the lamp light, face washed in warm gold and cool teal simultaneously. Behind him a second figure gestures expressively with open hands. A transparent mouse enclosure on a side shelf shows tiny healthy silhouettes moving freely. Through the doorway the corridor glows in cool hospital teal. Side-lighting with long warm shadows, radiant golden hour amber and deep teal contrast throughout.",
