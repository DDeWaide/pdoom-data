Ground-level view looking dramatically upward from the grass of a sun-drenched backyard, the entire scene bathed in deep golden hour amber, long shadows stretching across blades of grass rendered in warm teal and olive pixel clusters. The sky above is a radiant gradient of amber to deep cyan, side-lit with volumetric golden rays filtering through the silhouetted leaves of a backyard tree overhead. Dominating the upper frame, seen from directly below, a small boy with sneakers is caught mid-leap against the glowing sky, both feet off the ground, arms flung wide, his silhouette a triumphant arch against the amber light \u2014 the underside of pure joy viewed from the earth. To one side, partially visible from this low angle, a woman stands frozen with one hand pressed to her chest, her figure backlit in molten gold. Embedded in the lower corner of the frame, small and luminous against the warm teal shadows of the grass, a ghostly pixel-rendered fetal MRI scan glows \u2014 tiny brain cross-sections in teal and white, cerebellum sitting correctly in the skull. Beside it, nearly invisible in the grass, a translucent pale cream patch the size of a fingertip catches the golden light, glistening. Warm teal and deep amber dominate every pixel. Radiant. Side-lit. Quiet triumph.",
