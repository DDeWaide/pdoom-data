    "summary": "Russia just launched 345 drones and missiles at Ukraine in a single night, which is either a negotiating tactic or proof that 'ceasefire talks' is a phrase that means nothing. Meanwhile Zelensky is telling the BBC this is already World War 3, which tracks, and Iran still hasn't 'capitulated' despite Trump's evident puzzlement \u2014 apparently maximum pressure works on a different schedule than Mar-a-Lago expects. El Mencho is dead, cartel violence is exploding in tourist zones, and someone brought a shotgun and a fuel can to Trump's front door. Cheerful Monday.",

The scene is filtered through this atmospheric murk: a low-rise residential neighborhood of Soviet-era single-family homes with pitched roofs and bare winter trees standing skeletal against the darkness, a collapsed house in the middle distance with its roof caved inward, exposed interior walls showing pale wallpaper and tumbled timber, a debris field of frozen brick spreading across frost-hardened mud. Above the rooftops, the overcast clouds are lit from below by a distant orange glow \u2014 an apartment building upper floor burning, flames pushing through blown-out windows, a heavy black smoke column rising and folding into the fog layer. High overhead in the haze-filtered sky, dozens of small delta-wing silhouettes drift in irregular patterns, their faint propeller exhausts leaving tiny orange pinpoints dissolving into the murk. Upward-streaking interceptor missile trails cut bright white scratches through the navy darkness before vanishing into cloud. A damaged Orthodox church with a cracked onion dome is barely visible in the far background, its golden surface dulled to amber by smoke. Deep navy and smoldering orange dominate everything, warmth feels threatening, heavy shadows swallow the foreground, no text, no antialiasing."
